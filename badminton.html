      Badminton is a fast-paced racquet sport played in singles (one-on-one) or doubles (two-on-two) formats. It uses lightweight racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net. Players must be quick, agile, and precise, as the shuttlecock travels extremely fast‚Äîup to 400‚ÄØkm/h! Matches are usually best of three games to 21 points, played indoors to avoid wind interference.

      Governed by the Badminton World Federation (BWF), major tournaments include the BWF World Championships, the All England Open, Thomas Cup (men‚Äôs team), Uber Cup (women‚Äôs team), and the Olympic Games, which is considered one of the sport's most prestigious achievements. Badminton has been a part of the Summer Olympics since 1992 and is highly competitive at that level.

        The sport is especially popular in Asia, with countries like China, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and India dominating international competitions. European nations such as Denmark also have a strong badminton tradition. The game requires not just athleticism, but also tactical intelligence, stamina, and reflexes. With rapid rallies and high-intensity exchanges, badminton offers thrilling action for both players and spectators alike.
