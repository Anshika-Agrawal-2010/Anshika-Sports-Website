    Tennis is a high-intensity racquet sport played in singles (one-on-one) or doubles (two-on-two) formats. Players use a stringed racquet to strike a felt-covered rubber ball over a net and into the opponent’s court. The game is played on different surfaces such as grass, clay, and hard courts, each influencing the speed and style of play. Tennis demands a unique blend of physical endurance, agility, power, hand-eye coordination, and mental resilience. A point is won when the opponent fails to return the ball within the designated boundaries. Matches are generally played in best-of-three or best-of-five set formats depending on the tournament.

    The sport is governed globally by the International Tennis Federation (ITF), while professional tours are organized by the ATP (men’s) and WTA (women’s) associations. The pinnacle of competitive tennis is represented by the four Grand Slam tournaments: the <strong>Australian Open</strong> (played on hard courts in Melbourne), the <strong>French Open</strong> (on clay courts in Paris), <strong>Wimbledon</strong> (on grass courts in London), and the <strong>US Open</strong> (on hard courts in New York). Winning all four in a calendar year is considered the “Grand Slam” — one of the rarest and most prestigious feats in sports.

    Tennis is also a key part of the Summer Olympics, where players compete for medals and national glory, making it one of the few global sports to blend individual success with patriotic pride. The Davis Cup (men) and Billie Jean King Cup (women) are the main international team events, adding further dimension to tennis beyond individual rivalries.
