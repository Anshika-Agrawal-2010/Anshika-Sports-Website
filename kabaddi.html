      Kabaddi is a high-energy contact team sport that originated in ancient India. It involves two teams of seven players each, taking turns sending a "raider" into the opposing half to tag "defenders" and return safely, all in a single breath. The word "Kabaddi" is chanted by the raider during the attempt to prove they haven't inhaled again. The game combines agility, strength, strategy, and breath control, making it both thrilling to watch and challenging to play.

      Historically rooted in rural India, Kabaddi has evolved into an organized sport with national and international recognition. It is one of the few indigenous sports of India that has successfully transitioned to a global stage. With deep cultural ties to states like Tamil Nadu, Haryana, Punjab, and Maharashtra, Kabaddi has long been a symbol of grassroots athleticism and community spirit.

      The sport is governed by the Amateur Kabaddi Federation of India (AKFI) and internationally by the International Kabaddi Federation (IKF). The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Kabaddi_League">Pro Kabaddi League (PKL)</a>, launched in 2014, has been a game-changer, introducing modern formats, television coverage, and international talent to the Indian audience. Players like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anup_Kumar_(kabaddi)">Anup Kumar</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pardeep_Narwal">Pardeep Narwal</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manjeet_Chhillar">Manjeet Chhillar</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepak_Niwas_Hooda">Deepak Hooda</a> have become household names.

      Kabaddi is now played in over 30 countries including Iran, South Korea, Kenya, Bangladesh, and Japan. The Asian Games and the Kabaddi World Cup are major international platforms where India has traditionally dominated. Women's Kabaddi has also grown rapidly with structured leagues and tournaments emerging across Asia. The combination of tradition, speed, and raw physicality makes Kabaddi a truly unique sport on the global map.
