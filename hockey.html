      Hockey is a dynamic team sport played on grass, artificial turf, or indoors, where players use curved sticks to hit a small, hard ball and score goals. Each team has 11 players, including a goalkeeper, and the game emphasizes agility, coordination, and tactical awareness. Governed by the International Hockey Federation (FIH), modern field hockey matches are 60 minutes long, split into four quarters.

      Major international hockey events include the FIH Hockey World Cup, the Hockey Pro League, the Commonwealth Games, and the Olympic Games—one of the sport's most prestigious stages. India and the Netherlands have historically dominated men’s hockey, while the Netherlands and Australia have been leaders in women’s hockey.

      In India, hockey holds a historic place as the 'National Game of India'. India’s golden era spanned from the 1920s to the 1950s, with legends like Dhyan Chand leading the charge. The men's team has won 8 Olympic gold medals—the most by any nation, out of which 6 come in consecutive tournaments. With growing infrastructure and leagues like the Hockey India League (HIL), the sport is seeing renewed enthusiasm and development.
