      Chess is a two-player strategy board game originated in India, played on a checkered board with 64 squares arranged in an 8√ó8 grid. Each player begins with sixteen pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. The objective is to checkmate the opponent's king, a situation in which the king is under immediate threat of capture and there is no way to prevent it.

      The modern version of the game emerged in Europe during the 15th century and is governed internationally by FIDE (F√©d√©ration Internationale des √âchecs). Chess has evolved into a globally recognized sport with structured tournaments, timed matches, and an official rating system. The game emphasizes critical thinking, planning, pattern recognition, and memory, making it one of the most intellectually respected games in history.
