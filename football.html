    Football is the world‚Äôs most popular and widely played sport, often referred to as the ‚Äúbeautiful game.‚Äù It is played between two teams of eleven players on a rectangular field with a goal at each end. The primary objective is to score by getting the ball into the opposing goal using any part of the body except the hands and arms. Only the goalkeepers are allowed to use their hands, and only within the penalty area. Football is governed internationally by FIFA (F√©d√©ration Internationale de Football Association), which organizes the prestigious FIFA World Cup every four years, watched by billions globally.
